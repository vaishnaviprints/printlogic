## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Phase 1

### Critical (Must have before deployment):
1. Vendor Portal UI (2 pages: login + dashboard)
2. Socket.IO client integration in vendor dashboard
3. Admin Pricing Manager UI (1 page with CRUD)
4. Update App.js with all new routes
5. Test end-to-end flow

### Optional (Can add quickly):

## 📝 Testing Required

Once frontend is complete, test:
1. Customer registration → login → create order → view in My Orders
2. Vendor login → see order → accept → start → complete
3. Admin login → edit paper prices → verify audit created
4. Verify old orders unchanged after price edit
5. Socket notification when new order created

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Socket.IO integrated
- All endpoints tested via curl
- Database seeded with test data

### Frontend Status:
- Navigation/Footer integrated

- Vendor pages: backend ready, UI needed
- Admin pricing: backend ready, UI needed

### Estimated Time to Complete:
- Vendor Portal UI: 30 minutes
- Admin Pricing UI: 30 minutes
