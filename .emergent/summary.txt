The AI engineer's work evolved from an MVP to a comprehensive printing application for Vaishnavi Printers. Initial efforts focused on backend architecture for core features, leading to a critical URGENT FEATURE UPDATE that expanded functionality significantly to include admin/vendor CRUD, badges, and complex order management. Subsequent work concentrated on the frontend, specifically a Customer Print Portal with advanced pricing, multiple file uploads, and PDF page counting.

The most recent phase involved a massive feature rollout and bug fixes, iteratively addressing user feedback. Key areas included a comprehensive In-store Ordering System, Google OAuth integration, consistent UI (footer, locations), and critical admin/vendor portal enhancements like editable profiles, bank details, and a configurable commission system. The engineer prioritized fixing reported issues while systematically adding new features, often refactoring existing components or creating new ones for modularity. The trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach, albeit with a significant scope increase mid-development, requiring continuous adaptation and prioritization.

<product_requirements>
The Vaishnavi Printers application is a full-stack solution for printing services, featuring customer ordering, vendor fulfillment, and extensive admin management. Initially, it required pricing logic, live estimates, fulfillment rules, payment integration, notifications, and robust testing.

An URGENT UPDATE expanded the scope to include:
- Customer and Vendor authentication with respective portals.
- Admin pricing manager with audit trails and S3 file uploads.
- Enhanced admin/vendor management (CRUD, badges, sales-based rewards, store on/off, order assignment).
- Real-time notifications via WebSockets.
- Public pages (Home, About Us, Contact Us, Order Tracking) and forgot password for all user types.
- A robust Customer Print Portal for multiple file uploads, auto page counting, printing preview, and dynamic pricing (70 GSM B/W, 100 GSM Color, quantity, double-sided, delivery type, hard binding, A3 B/W, A4/A3 lamination per page).
- An In-store Ordering System with QR code access, cash/online payments, and a dedicated staff interface (pending).
- Secure, print-only vendor file viewing (no save/screenshot).

Further user requests included:
- Google OAuth for customers, consistent footer across pages.
- Admin panel filters, vendor banking details (vendor self-managed), editable vendor profiles, custom fields.
- Admin pricing edit functionality, global location updates to Hyderabad.
- Settings page for currency and commission management.
- Vendor export to CSV, complaints/feedback section.
- Assistant Admin with role-based access.
- Unique QR codes per vendor, vendor login management (reset/forgot).
- Enhanced Vendor Dashboard (orders, store toggle, loud alerts, specific pricing, statements).
- In-store popup tray for orders.
- Comprehensive Terms & Conditions for customer and vendor.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently implementing the **commission system** for vendors and administrators. This involved:
1.  **Adding Badge & Commission Display to Vendor Dashboard**: The vendor dashboard () was modified to show the vendor's current badge level and progress towards the next milestone.
2.  **Creating Backend Endpoints for Commission Management**: A new backend file, , was created to handle the logic for setting and retrieving commission percentages. This router was then integrated into the main FastAPI application ().
3.  **Adding Commission Settings UI to Admin Settings Page**: The admin settings page () was slated for an enhancement. A new file, , was created, presumably to include an interface where the super admin can adjust the platform's commission percentage (e.g., 5% to 7%). This update is critical for automatically calculating vendor payouts (total collection minus commission).

At the very end of the trajectory, the AI engineer was in the process of replacing the old  with the newly created . This indicates the commission feature's frontend integration was in its final stages. The overarching goal is to enable dynamic, admin-controlled commission rates that automatically factor into vendor payouts and to provide vendors visibility into their performance via badges.
