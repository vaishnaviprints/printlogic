The AI engineer began by clarifying requirements for the Vaishnavi Printers application, focusing on payment gateways, notifications, delivery, admin auth, and file storage. It then adopted a phased implementation approach, starting with backend core features, testing, and then frontend UI. A significant refactor and expansion was requested for Phase 1 including customer/vendor portals, admin pricing, file uploads, and payment. After delivering Phase 1 (frontend UI still in progress), an URGENT FEATURE UPDATE introduced comprehensive admin/vendor enhancements, badge systems, and order assignment logic. The engineer has since focused on backend implementation for these new features, delivering a production-ready backend with detailed API documentation and a Postman collection for verification, while deferring the associated frontend UI work.

<product_requirements>
The Vaishnavi Printers application requires a minimal-code, full-stack solution with complete business logic: pricing (paper types, lamination, binding, addons, delivery), estimate behavior (live updates), fulfillment rules (pickup auto-assign, delivery partner booking), payment control (admin-selected gateway, server-side session/webhooks), and simulated notifications. Key constraints include preference for configuration over custom code, small server functions, and a rule engine for business logic. Non-negotiable testing covers all core logic. Deliverables include a code repo, documentation, seed data, API docs, and an acceptance test script. The URGENT UPDATE expanded this to a phased approach (Phase 1, Phase 2). Phase 1 features included customer auth, vendor portal with real-time notifications, admin pricing manager with audit, S3 file upload, and payment gateway control. The most recent URGENT FEATURE UPDATE further enhanced admin/vendor management (CRUD, badges, sales-based rewards, store on/off, accept/decline logic), order workflow (assignment, reassign, proofs), and real-time notifications via WebSockets, all to be implemented and tested in a SIMULATED mode.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.


**Key Files and Changes:**
- : The central FastAPI application. It has been extensively updated in multiple steps to include customer/vendor authentication, admin pricing manager, file upload, payment, order creation/management, and real-time notification endpoints, as well as admin vendor management and badge configuration.
- : Defines Pydantic models for MongoDB documents like , , , , , and . Recently updated to add  to  and new fields to  (e.g., , , , ).
- , : New files implementing JWT-based authentication with email/password and mobile OTP support for customers and vendors respectively.
- : New file to manage Socket.IO connections for real-time notifications to vendors.
- : New file defining the vendor badge configuration and logic for auto-assigning badges based on sales thresholds.
- : New file implementing the complex order assignment logic, including querying eligible vendors, tentative assignments, acceptance timeouts, and reassignments.
- : Updated to create initial admin, customer, and multiple vendor test accounts with new fields.
- : New configuration files for price rules, delivery partners, payment gateways, and badge thresholds.
- : Updated to define routes for all new pages, including public, customer, vendor, and admin sections, and integrated  and  components. Fixed JSX escaped quotes issue.
- , : New components for consistent navigation and footer across the application.
- , : Numerous new React page components for customer registration/login, My Orders, vendor login/dashboard, admin dashboard, admin pricing manager, and admin vendor manager.
- : Updated to include  and  dependencies.
- : Expanded to include tests for pricing, vendors, and delivery logic.
- , : New documentation and Postman collection to detail the recently implemented backend API endpoints.

<pending_tasks>
- Frontend UI for Admin Pricing Manager (edit forms).
- Frontend UI for Admin Vendors Management (list, CRUD, profile views).
- Frontend UI for Vendor Dashboard enhancements (earnings tab, accept/decline buttons, badge display).
- Frontend UI for displaying vendor badges and certified status.
- Frontend UI for customer order timeline.
- Implementation of remaining public pages (Vendor Instructions, Customer Instructions, T&C, Contact Us).
- Full delivery partner adapters (currently simulated).
- Enhanced reports for Admin.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a substantial backend implementation addressing the URGENT FEATURE UPDATE requirements. This includes:
- **Admin Enhancements**: Backend APIs for editing pricing rules with audit trails, comprehensive vendor CRUD operations, and configuring badge thresholds.
- **Vendor Portal Logic**: Backend support for vendor registration, toggling  status, handling order acceptance/declining (with a 2-minute timeout and auto-reassignment logic), and tracking total sales and earnings.
- **Order Flow**: Enhanced order creation to include complex vendor assignment,  tracking, and  preservation for historical orders. Real-time notifications for vendors are integrated via Socket.IO.
- **Badge System**: A 6-tier badge system (none, bronze, silver, gold, diamond, platinum) is implemented with auto-calculation based on .
- **Database updates**:  and  have been updated to reflect new vendor and order fields.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation () and a Postman collection () have been created for the newly implemented backend endpoints, making them ready for external testing.

The backend functionality is declared production-ready and deployed at https://printlogic-app.preview.emergentagant.com/api. The frontend UI for these new backend features is currently pending and estimated to require approximately 4 hours of work.
