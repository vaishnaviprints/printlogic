The AI engineer's work trajectory chronicles the development of the Vaishnavi Printers application, initially from an MVP to a feature-rich platform. It began with clarifying core requirements (payment, notifications, delivery, admin auth, file storage) and then expanded significantly to include customer/vendor portals, admin pricing, and real-time order management. A critical URGENT FEATURE UPDATE led to a production-ready backend for admin/vendor CRUD, badge systems, and complex order assignment logic, documented with API docs and a Postman collection.

The current phase focuses on frontend UI implementation for these backend features. The engineer systematically addressed user feedback, including debugging deployment/caching issues, adding navigation, public pages, forgot password functionality, and a smart order tracking system. Crucially, significant effort was dedicated to building a comprehensive Customer Print Portal, addressing multiple file uploads, accurate PDF page counting (after several iterations due to runtime errors and CDN issues), dynamic pricing based on paper type, double-sided printing, and copies count. Most recently, the engineer initiated the development of an In-store Ordering System with cash/online payment options and a QR code integration, with a strong focus on secure file handling for vendors.

<product_requirements>
The Vaishnavi Printers application aims to provide a full-stack solution for printing services, encompassing customer ordering, vendor fulfillment, and comprehensive admin management. Initial requirements included pricing logic, live estimates, fulfillment rules (pickup/delivery), payment gateway integration (admin-selected, server-side), simulated notifications, and non-negotiable testing. Deliverables were a code repo, documentation, seed data, API docs, and acceptance tests.

An URGENT UPDATE expanded this, adding:
- Customer authentication.
- Vendor portal with real-time notifications.
- Admin pricing manager with audit trails.
- S3 file uploads.
- Payment gateway control.
- Enhanced admin/vendor management (CRUD, badges, sales-based rewards, store on/off, accept/decline logic).
- Advanced order workflow (assignment, reassign, proofs).
- Real-time notifications via WebSockets.
- Public-facing pages (Home, About Us, Contact Us, Order Tracking).
- Forgot password functionality for customers and vendors.
- A robust Customer Print Portal supporting multiple file types, auto page counting, printing preview, dynamic pricing based on paper type (70 GSM B/W, 100 GSM Color), quantity, double-sided printing, and delivery type-based charges.
- An In-store Ordering System with QR code for customer access, cash/online payment options, and a dedicated interface for staff to manage orders.
- A critical security feature: vendor viewing of customer files must be print-only, preventing screenshots or saving.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of building a comprehensive **In-store Ordering System** for the Vaishnavi Printers application, directly addressing a recent user request. This system aims to facilitate customer orders within a physical shop environment via a QR code, offering both Cash and Online payment options.

Specifically, the work immediately preceding this summary involved:
1.  **CustomerPrintPortal.js modification**:
    *   Adding a payment method selection interface *before* the delivery type selection.
    *   Updating the order submission () logic to properly handle both Cash and Online payment methods.
2.  **OrderSuccessPage.js creation**: A new page was created to display the generated Order ID after a successful order submission, which is crucial for both cash and online payment workflows.
3.  **Initiating QR code integration**: The next immediate step identified was to install a QR code library, likely for generating the QR code that directs customers to the .

This work builds upon significant recent enhancements to the , including:
*   Robust PDF page counting using  (after fixing multiple runtime and CDN-related errors).
*   Dynamic pricing calculations incorporating specific paper GSM (70 for B/W, 100 for Color), tiered pricing based on page count, correct double-sided printing sheet calculation, and factoring in copies count for pricing tiers.
*   Integration with delivery type to adjust final estimates.

The overall goal is to streamline the in-store ordering experience and lay the groundwork for a dedicated staff-facing application to manage these orders.
