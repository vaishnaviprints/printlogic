## 🚀 Socket.IO Client Snippet (For Integration)

// Vendor Socket.IO Integration
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const vendorId = localStorage.getItem('vendor_id');
const socket = io('https://printlogic-app.preview.emergentagent.com', {
  path: '/socket.io',
  auth: { vendor_id: vendorId },
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
});

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to notification service');
});

socket.on('notification', (data) => {
  console.log('New notification:', data);
  // Update UI: show toast, play sound, update bell
  playNotificationSound();
  fetchOrders(); // Refresh order list
});

socket.on('notification_count', (data) => {
  // Update bell badge
  setBellCount(data.count);
});

// Mark notifications as read
function markAsRead() {
  socket.emit('mark_read', {});
}
```
