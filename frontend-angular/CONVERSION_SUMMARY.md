## Angular Conversion Summary

This directory contains the Angular version of the Vaishnavi Printers frontend application.

### What's Been Converted

✅ **Project Structure**: Complete Angular project setup with proper modules and routing
✅ **Routing**: All routes from React app converted to Angular routing
✅ **Services**: Authentication and API services implemented
✅ **Guards**: Auth guard for protected routes
✅ **Home Page**: Fully implemented with original design
✅ **Page Components**: All 22 page components created (most are stubs for now)

### What Still Needs Work

⚠️ **Page Components**: Most pages are stubs and need full implementation
⚠️ **UI Components**: Shared components need to be created (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
⚠️ **Forms**: Form handling needs to be implemented with Angular Reactive Forms
⚠️ **Socket.io**: Real-time features need to be implemented
⚠️ **PDF Handling**: PDF viewer and upload functionality needs implementation
⚠️ **Charts**: Chart components need to be integrated

### How to Run

```bash
cd frontend-angular
npm install
npm start
```

### Key Files

- `src/app/app.module.ts` - Main module with all components
- `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` - Routing configuration
- `src/app/services/auth.service.ts` - Authentication service
- `src/app/services/api.service.ts` - API service
- `src/app/pages/home-page/` - Fully implemented home page
- `src/styles.scss` - Global styles with Tailwind CSS

### Environment Setup

Update `src/environments/environment.ts` with your backend URL:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  backendUrl: 'http://localhost:5000'
};
```

### Next Steps

1. Implement each page component by converting the React JSX to Angular templates
2. Create shared UI components library
3. Implement form handling with Angular Reactive Forms
4. Add Socket.io for real-time features
5. Implement PDF handling and uploads
6. Add chart components for dashboard
7. Add unit tests
